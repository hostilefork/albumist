	Albumist was written to work with The Legendary Pink Dots' new website,
	with the goal of helping fans get involved in managing their prolific
	discography.  Please check out their music:

	...and see them on their 2008 tour!

	<!--
	(Note: Don't be afraid of the length of this file.  Albumist is very easy
	to use in your webpage.  It "works" with as little code as:
		
		<div id="discography">	
		</div>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="albumist.js"> </script>
		<script type="text/javascript">
		Albumist.displayByBandName("discography", "The Legendary Pink Dots");
		</script>
	
	But this is just some rather thorough "living" documentation of all the
	configuration options.  Hence the length.  It is my hope that Albumist
	will become even more flexible in the future, so there will be even 
	more options!

		Because The Dots' site uses the Joomla! content management system, it
		was fairly obvious we'd be using mootools as the JavaScript library.
		The only version thta has been tested is with mootools 1.11, because
		that is what Joomla! 1.5 shipped with.
		
		If you are using Joomla 1.5 then you are in luck.  But you are probably
		not, so you'll have to figure out whether a manual inclusion of
		mootools 1.11 is appropriate for your project.  It hasn't been tested
		with other versions, and I don't currently know enough about what is a
		compatible subset of the library to change it for 1.2 or later.

		<!-- 
		Web standards say scripts can appear anywhere, but CSS stylesheets
		only in the <head></head>!  Albumist can inject its css into the
		head of your page when it runs, which is the default.  Or you can put
		it in the header yourself and suppress the injection by setting
		injectCSS to false.  For this demo we will do the latter.
		-->
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="albumist.css">
		<!--
		(Note: The code doesn't use CSS effectively right now.  So if you are
		good at that sort of thing and all that margin/padding stuff doesn't
		make you want to put a rock through your monitor, then your help in
		improving it would be appreciated!)

	This is the placeholder, which is where albumist will place the table of
	albums in the page.  Because you pass the ID of the placeholder to the
	albumist script, it is possible to put several discographies on the
	same page.  This may become more useful as albumist gets features to
	help subselect major and minor releases.

		// Lyric Wiki Policy on names is to capitalize the 
		// first letter of each song or band with the rest lowercase, and 
		// turn spaces into underscores:
		//
		//	http://lyricwiki.org/LyricWiki:Page_names
		//
		// So Albumist will guess at the name by trying to apply those rules to
		// the names as they appear on Freebase.  However, there are exceptions
		// to the rule everywhere.  For instance "The Legendary Pink Dots" are
		// just "Legendary_Pink_Dots" on LyricWiki.  Until Freebase has a way
		// for us to point out the exceptions in the names, you must either
		// edit Freebase or LyricWiki to make them match up.  
		//
		// Often that isn't appropriate for some reason (such as that it would
		// not be appropriate to turn "ABBA" on LyricWiki into "Abba", and
		// they'd probably also frown on breaking all the links to 
		// "Legendary_Pink_Dots" by renaming them to "The_Legendary_Pink_Dots"
		// just to make this Album script happier).  So in cases like that,
		// the following configuration settings let you override the names
		// Albumist uses when it looks up lyrics and bands.
		//
		// Notice that by design, Albumist does not try to find the album pages
