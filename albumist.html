	Albumist was written to work with The Legendary Pink Dots' new website,
	with the goal of helping fans get involved in managing their prolific
	discography.  Please check out their music: 
		
			http://legendarypinkdots.org/music
			
	...and see them on their 2008 tour!

	<!--
	(Note: Don't be afraid of the length of this file.  Albumist is very easy
	to use in your webpage.  It "works" with as little code as:
		
		<div id="discography">	
		</div>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="albumist.js"> </script>
		<script type="text/javascript">
		Albumist.displayByBandName("discography", "The Legendary Pink Dots");
		</script>
	
	But this is just some rather thorough "living" documentation of all the
	configuration options.  Hence the length.  It is my hope that Albumist
	will become even more flexible in the future, so there will be even 
	more options!

		Because The Dots' site used the Joomla! content management system, it
		was fairly obvious we'd be using mootools as the JavaScript library.
		The only version thta has been tested is with mootools 1.11, because
		that is what Joomla! 1.5 shipped with.
		
		The trend away from mootools and toward jQuery has been further
		established by Joomla no longer using that.  So the arduous work of
		converting to a jQuery plugin was undertaken.

		Web standards say scripts can appear anywhere, but CSS stylesheets
		only in the <head></head>!  Albumist can inject its css into the
		head of your page when it runs, which is the default.  Or you can put
		it in the header yourself and suppress the injection by setting
		injectCSS to false.  For this demo we will do the latter.

		(Note: The code doesn't use CSS effectively right now.  So if you are
		good at that sort of thing and all that margin/padding stuff doesn't
		make you want to put a rock through your monitor, then your help in
		improving it would be appreciated!)
