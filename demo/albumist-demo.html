	(Note: Don't be afraid of the length of this file.  Albumist is very easy
	to use in your webpage.  It "works" with as little html as:
		
		<div id="discography">	
		</div>

	...with a corresponding JavaScript call that looks like:

		$("#discography).albumist({
			bandName: "The Legendary Pink Dots"
		});

	(Of course the necessary inclusions you would expect; you need to be using
	jQuery, have your HTML doctype, all the usual things you likely know some
	bit about if you're making a web page.)
	
	But that's just a default layout which you probably want to change.  So
	this is just some explicit "living" documentation of all the
	configuration options.  Hence the length.  Because this plug-in was
	initially created for the Legendary Pink Dots band site to manage their
	prolific catalog, I'll use them for the example...

	I'd hope that people help make Albumist even more flexible in the future,
	so there will be even more options!
